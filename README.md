=================

These files are an opinionated list of what I use when running Wordpress locally. They may or may not work for you.

## Usage

After setting up Wordpress locally, drop these files in the root directory.

You'll want to rename the gitignore file and add the dot.

Then you'll need to setup your remote server information in wp-config.php and your local server info in local-config.php.
