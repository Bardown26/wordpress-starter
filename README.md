wordpress-starter
=================

Starter files when setting up a new Wordpress installation.

These files are an opinionated list of what I use when running Wordpress locally. They may or may not work for you.

## Usage

After setting up Wordpress locally, drop these files in the root directory. Then you'll need to setup your remote server information in wp-config.php and your local server info in local-config.php.
